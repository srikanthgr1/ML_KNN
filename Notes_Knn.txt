K N N - K Nearest Neighbours 

Eager Learning - Learn on training and have model ready (Decission Trees, Naive Baiyesm SVM, NN)

Lazy LEarning - When we need to check for new data the patterns are udnerstood and values are predicted. doesnot store any learning , when test data is given it runs onf training data and then learns ( KNN )


KNN : Summary -->

Guidelines to chose k value 
1) k = Square root of number of instances is a good starting point to choose K values
2) Do a K-fold CV for diffn values of k
